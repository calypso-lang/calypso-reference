# Introduction

*The Calypso Book* is a guide on how to write code in Calypso.

Currently this guide will not describe the Calypso build tool and command-line interface as those are not yet fully designed (and they may get their own book eventualy).

# Notation

Calypso code will be written in code blocks like this:

```calypso
fn main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Things to look out for or further explanations of things may be provided in notes like this:
> Note: This is a note!

Or in warnings like this:

<div class="warning">

Warning: This is a warning. Oh no!

</div>
